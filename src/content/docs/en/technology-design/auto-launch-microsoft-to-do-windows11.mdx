## Background: Why I Did This

Time management is something we have to adjust throughout our lives — and for me, it’s always been a challenge.

For the past three years, I mainly relied on **a physical notebook and pen** to manage my time. But over the last two months, that stopped working as well as before. So I decided to try a small improvement:

Let **Microsoft To Do** pop up automatically when my computer starts. That way, I see my priorities right away. I rarely work in full-screen mode, so there’s always some space for the To Do window to stay visible.

The key to building habits is a **trigger** — and startup is a natural one.

This post records how I set it up: making Microsoft To Do automatically open on Windows 11 login.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Run PowerShell as Administrator

1. Search for **“PowerShell”** in the Start menu.
2. **Right-click** it → choose **“Run as administrator.”**
   (Otherwise, you’ll get an “Access is denied” error.)
3. Paste the following command into the PowerShell window.
   If there’s no error, it worked successfully.
   (If it fails, it’s usually due to user permissions or Task Scheduler settings.)

```powershell
$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "explorer.exe" -Argument "shell:AppsFolder\Microsoft.Todos_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App"
$Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogOn
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "LaunchToDo" -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -Description "startup Microsoft To Do" -User "$env:USERNAME"
```

---

### Check if the Task Was Created

1. Open **Task Scheduler** (search it from the Start menu).
2. Click **“Task Scheduler Library”** on the left panel.
3. Find the task named `LaunchToDo` (if you used my script).
4. Double-click it and check:

   * **Trigger:** “At log on”
   * **Action:** runs `explorer.exe` with argument `shell:AppsFolder\Microsoft.Todos_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App`
   * **General tab:** “Run only when user is logged on” is checked
5. Or simply **restart your computer** to see if Microsoft To Do opens automatically after login.

## Further Exploration: Understanding the Logic

### Explaining the Commands

**Create the launch action**

```powershell
$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "explorer.exe" -Argument "shell:AppsFolder\Microsoft.Todos_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App"
```

* `New-ScheduledTaskAction` defines what the task will do.
* `-Execute "explorer.exe"` means using Windows Explorer to launch something.
* `-Argument "shell:AppsFolder\..."` is a **UWP app path**, pointing to Microsoft To Do.

💡 *Why use explorer.exe?*

UWP apps don’t have a traditional `.exe` file. Using `explorer.exe` opens their **app container path**, so the app launches in a normal window.


**Set the trigger**

```powershell
$Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogOn
```

* `New-ScheduledTaskTrigger` defines when the task runs.
* `-AtLogOn` means it triggers when the user logs in (not when the system boots).

✅ This ensures To Do launches visibly, not silently in the background.



**Register the task**

```powershell
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "LaunchToDo" -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -Description "Launch Microsoft To Do" -User "$env:USERNAME"
```

* `Register-ScheduledTask` saves the task to the system.
* `-TaskName` is the name you give it.
* `-Action` and `-Trigger` refer to what we defined earlier.
* `-Description` adds a short note.
* `-User "$env:USERNAME"` binds it to the current user.

### Where Does `8wekyb3d8bbwe!App` Come From?

That’s the **internal launch ID** of the UWP app.
The structure looks like this:

```
shell:AppsFolder\PackageFamilyName!AppId
```

* `Microsoft.Todos_8wekyb3d8bbwe` → **Package Family Name**
* `!App` → default **App ID**

📌 To find other UWP app IDs, run:

```powershell
Get-StartApps
```

You’ll get a list like:

```
Name             AppUserModelId
----             ---------------
Microsoft To Do  Microsoft.Todos_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App
```

---

### Does This Work for All UWP Apps?

✅ **Mostly yes**, but with some conditions:

* The app must support launching via `AppUserModelId`.
* Some system or restricted apps may not open this way.
* If an app doesn’t launch, check its ID with `Get-StartApps`.

---

### How to Delete the Task

**Are `$Action` and `$Trigger` temporary? Can I rename them?**

* Yes — they are just temporary PowerShell variables.
* You can rename them (e.g., `$a`, `$myTrigger`) freely.
* The real “permanent” part is the registered task in Task Scheduler.

📌 To delete it later, run:

```powershell
Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName "LaunchToDo" -Confirm:$false
```

### What If It’s Not a UWP App?

#### 🛠 Launch on startup but not show a window

1. Non-UWP apps have `.exe` files, so you can create shortcuts.
2. Press **Win + R**, type `shell:startup`, and hit Enter.
3. Drop your app’s shortcut into the opened folder.
   (If you don’t have a shortcut, find it in the Start menu → right-click → *More* → *Open file location* → then create a shortcut.)

Now the app will automatically run every time you log in.

---

#### 📅 Launch a window after login (non-UWP)

1. Open **Task Scheduler**.
2. Click **“Create Basic Task.”**
3. Name it something like “Launch ***”.
4. Set the trigger to **“When I log on.”**
5. Choose **“Start a program”** and browse to the `.exe` file.
6. Finish the setup.

Windows prevents background tasks from showing UI unless they’re explicitly set to run after user login.

📌 If you want to delay launch or use more complex triggers, Task Scheduler is the right place.

## Conclusion

Most of this setup came from AI assistance — I mainly asked questions, tested commands, and organized these notes.

What I realized: command-line tools and GUI operations now map quite directly, but personally, I’m starting to prefer **code-based workflows**.
Honestly, GUI interfaces often feel clumsy compared to a clean command.
