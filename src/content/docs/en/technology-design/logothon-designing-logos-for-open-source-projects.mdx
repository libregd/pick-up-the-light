title: 'Logothon: Designing Logos for Open Source Projects'
description: ''

**Author:libregd**

## Why I Started This

1. As a designer who is currently learning programming, I‚Äôve benefited a lot from open source projects, tutorials, books, templates, and tools on GitHub.  
   This challenge is not only a way to improve my own design skills but also a way to give something back to the community.  

2. Logos add recognition, a sense of formality, and even emotion to a project.  
   By creating logos, I also got a deeper understanding of different programming concepts and domains.

## My Process

1. **License first** ‚Äì projects with GPL or other strong open source licenses come first. The more aligned with the ‚Äúopen source spirit,‚Äù the higher the priority.  
2. If a project already has a mature logo in use, I skip it ‚Äî other projects need design support more.  
3. I prefer projects where the logo request feels challenging, such as domains or industries I‚Äôve never worked in before.  
4. I review the project‚Äôs README, website (if available), and the issue discussion. I also use AI tools to help me understand technical concepts that are new to me.  
5. Next, I look for inspiration. I define some keywords based on my understanding of the project and then expand them into related ideas. On average, I collect around **100 reference images** per project.  
6. I sketch rough ideas, then refine them in Affinity Designer as precise vector drawings.  
7. I export the designs as **SVG**, prepare mockups in Figma, and create preview images.  
8. I open a new issue to share the logo proposal and wait for feedback.  
9. If the proposal is accepted, I follow up with a PR as agreed.

## Challenges Along the Way

1. Some projects looked very interesting but had no license specified, so I had to skip them.  
2. A few ‚Äúneed logo‚Äù issues weren‚Äôt serious requests ‚Äî just casual comments. Larger projects usually had more contributors confirming whether the need was real, which was helpful as an outsider.  
3. In some cases, maintainers didn‚Äôt respond. Later I found that even though the issue was new, the project itself had been inactive for a year.

---

## Reflections on Workflow

1. During the inspiration phase, AI tools were especially useful in helping me expand keywords ‚Äî particularly since English is not my native language.  
   For example, starting from the word *book*, I could expand to ideas like discipline, persistence, wisdom, and growth.  
2. The most challenging part was digging deeper into the project itself. For example, with **Kustomize**, my understanding kept evolving, which meant I had to throw away earlier sketches. I ended up collecting **169 reference images** for that project alone, because I changed direction several times.

## Results and Next Steps

- In one week, I submitted **8 logo proposals**.  
  - **2** maintainers invited me to submit PRs.  
  - **1** is still in discussion/iteration.  
  - **1** was rejected.  
  - **4** haven‚Äôt received a response yet.  

- Looking ahead, I‚Äôm considering:  
  - Running **Logothon** as a recurring activity ‚Äî it helps me grow while helping others.  
  - Expanding beyond logos to UI/UX or documentation covers (maybe that would become a **Designathon**).  
  - Writing a small **‚ÄúOpen Source Design Guide‚Äù** based on this process for others to follow.

*Thanks for reading. If you‚Äôre maintaining a project that needs a logo, feel free to open an issue ‚Äî maybe it‚Äôll be part of the next Logothon.*
