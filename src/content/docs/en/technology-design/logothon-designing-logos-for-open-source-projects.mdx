title: 'Logothon: Designing Logos for Open Source Projects'
description: ''

**Author:libregd**

## Why I Started This

1. As a designer who is currently learning programming, I’ve benefited a lot from open source projects, tutorials, books, templates, and tools on GitHub.  
   This challenge is not only a way to improve my own design skills but also a way to give something back to the community.  

2. Logos add recognition, a sense of formality, and even emotion to a project.  
   By creating logos, I also got a deeper understanding of different programming concepts and domains.

## My Process

1. **License first** – projects with GPL or other strong open source licenses come first. The more aligned with the “open source spirit,” the higher the priority.  
2. If a project already has a mature logo in use, I skip it — other projects need design support more.  
3. I prefer projects where the logo request feels challenging, such as domains or industries I’ve never worked in before.  
4. I review the project’s README, website (if available), and the issue discussion. I also use AI tools to help me understand technical concepts that are new to me.  
5. Next, I look for inspiration. I define some keywords based on my understanding of the project and then expand them into related ideas. On average, I collect around **100 reference images** per project.  
6. I sketch rough ideas, then refine them in Affinity Designer as precise vector drawings.  
7. I export the designs as **SVG**, prepare mockups in Figma, and create preview images.  
8. I open a new issue to share the logo proposal and wait for feedback.  
9. If the proposal is accepted, I follow up with a PR as agreed.

## Challenges Along the Way

1. Some projects looked very interesting but had no license specified, so I had to skip them.  
2. A few “need logo” issues weren’t serious requests — just casual comments. Larger projects usually had more contributors confirming whether the need was real, which was helpful as an outsider.  
3. In some cases, maintainers didn’t respond. Later I found that even though the issue was new, the project itself had been inactive for a year.

## Reflections on Workflow

1. During the inspiration phase, AI tools were especially useful in helping me expand keywords — particularly since English is not my native language.  
   For example, starting from the word *book*, I could expand to ideas like discipline, persistence, wisdom, and growth.  
2. The most challenging part was digging deeper into the project itself. For example, with **Kustomize**, my understanding kept evolving, which meant I had to throw away earlier sketches. I ended up collecting **169 reference images** for that project alone, because I changed direction several times.

## Results and Next Steps

- In one week, I submitted **8 logo proposals**.  
  - **2** maintainers invited me to submit PRs.  
  - **1** is still in discussion/iteration.  
  - **1** was rejected.  
  - **4** haven’t received a response yet.  

- Looking ahead, I’m considering:  
  - Running **Logothon** as a recurring activity — it helps me grow while helping others.  :[logothon is actived](https://logothon.pages.dev/)
  - Expanding beyond logos to UI/UX or documentation covers (maybe that would become a **Designathon**).  
  - Writing a small **“Open Source Design Guide”** based on this process for others to follow.

*Thanks for reading. If you’re maintaining a project that needs a logo, feel free to open an issue — maybe it’ll be part of the next Logothon.*
